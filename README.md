# QRCashCard
A private, open-source QR/chip card co-op—load cash, spend anywhere, no bank fees.
Hey Devs,  
**Problem**: Cash dies—pennies cost 3.69 cents, worth 1, hoarders kill it. Cards skim 2-3% ($1T, 2023). People want cash’s ease, no fees, no bank leash.  
**Fix**: A private co-op QR/chip card—$1 or free, 50-cent load, members-only. Load it anywhere—cash, bank, employer. Scan or swipe—$87.42 grocery, $702B remittances (2020)—instant, private spends, no fee gouge. Balance on scan, no app. Open-source, decentralized, gift-card-legal ($200B, 2023).  
**Why**: Saves cash, cuts banks ($5T deposits, 2023) out, scales global. Load $50, spend anywhere—keep it, gift it, 3D-print it. No suits, just us—members run it.  
**Build**: QR’s everywhere, NFC’s standard, nodes track loads—simple, now. I’m a breeder, not a dev—saw this fixing messes. No credit needed—make it real.
